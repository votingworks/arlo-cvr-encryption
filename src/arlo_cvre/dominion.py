# Arlo-e2e support for CVR files from Dominion ballot scanners.
# Each data file looks something like this:
# Line 1: Name of election,unknown field (probably a version number),lots of blank fields
# Line 2: Seven commas,contest title,contest title,... [titles repeat; columns represent a specific candidate or choice]
# Line 3: Seven commas,candidate-or-choice text,... [for yes/no votes, the text here will be "yes" or "no",
#         or sometimes "yes/for" and "no/against"]
# Line 4: Column identifiers (for the first seven columns), then optional party identifiers
#     CvrNumber,TabulatorNum,BatchId,RecordId,ImprintedId,PrecinctPortion,BallotType,...
# Lines 5+: First seven columns correspond to the identifiers, then a sequence of 1/0's
# Notes:
# - Sometimes, there are quotation marks around the entries, other times, not.
# - Sometimes there are equals signs before the quotation marks, so sometimes <<<="3">>> and other times <<<3>>>
# - The number of column identifiers above isn't fixed. Sometimes it's seven, sometimes eight.
#   - Eight entry: CvrNumber,TabulatorNum,BatchId,RecordId,ImprintedId,CountingGroup,PrecinctPortion,BallotType
#   - Seven entry: CvrNumber,TabulatorNum,BatchId,RecordId,ImprintedId,PrecinctPortion,BallotType
#   - The CvrNumber appears to be sequential and always starts with 1.
#   - We can probably treat "CountingGroup" as an empty-string when we don't have it, otherwise make a ballot UID
#     from an 8-tuple of all these strings.
#   - The "CountingGroup" can be "Regular", "Provisional", "Mail", "Election Day", "In Person", or other strings.
#     - We might want special handling for Provisional ballots.
# - A write-in slot is still just voted as 1 or 0. This means tons of extra work for an election official
#   if a write-in actually wins.
# - Undervotes are sometimes indicated as an empty-string as distinct from a 0. We'll just map these to zeros.
# - BallotType appears to be an identifier of a ballot style, i.e., every row in this sheet having the
#   same BallotType represents a voter who was given the same choices on their ballot.
# Also, just to be annoying, the way that Pandas indicates that it has no value in a numeric cell? NaN.
# Even when we explicitly set it to None, what we get back is NaN.
