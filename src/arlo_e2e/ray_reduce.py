# This is an attempt to build a more sophisticated reducer that takes as much advantage of the
# associate & commutative nature of what we're doing -- that is, we can compute the ballot tallies
# in any order.

# The implementation seems to run correctly, and slightly faster than the version that does everything
# in order, but the progress-bar support is somehow broken. (Stutters, pauses. Doesn't terminate at
# 100%.) And it's deeply unclear that this code scales to huge clusters. ray.wait() may or may not
# be able to handle that many ObjectRefs.

    Given a list of inputs and a Ray remote reducer, manages the Ray cluster to wait for the values
    when they're ready, and call the reducer to ultimately get down to a single value. An ObjectRef
    to that result is returned.

    The `shard_size` parameter specifies how many inputs should be fed to each call to the reducer.
    Since the available data will vary, the actual number fed to the reducer will be at least two
    and at most `shard_size`.

    The `timeout` specifies the number of seconds to wait for results to become available. If
    `shard_size*shard_size` results are available earlier, that will take precedence. Otherwise, as long as
    at least two results are available when the timeout happens, at least one reducer will be dispatched.

    (Why `shard_size*shard_size`? If `shard_size` was 10, this means we'll dispatch ten calls to the
    reducer with ten inputs each, which means fewer trips through `ray.wait`. The timeout takes
    precedence over this, guaranteeing a minimum dispatch rate.)

    The `reducer` is a Ray remote method reference that takes a given first argument of whatever
    type and then a varargs sequence of objectrefs, and returns an objectref. So, if you had
    code that looked like:

    ```
    @ray.remote
    def my_reducer(config: Config, *inputs: MyDataType) -> MyDataType:
        ...
    ```

    And let's say you're mapping some remote function to generate those values and later want
    to reduce them. That code might look like this:
    ```
    @ray.remote
    def my_mapper(input: SomethingElse) -> MyDataType:
        ...

    def run_everything(config: Config, inputs: Iterable[SomethingElse]) -> MyDataType:
        map_refs = [my_mapper.remote(i) for i in inputs]
        return ray_reduce_with_ray_wait(map_refs, 10, config, my_reducer.remote)
    ```

    If your `reducer_first_arg` corresponds to some large object that you don't want to serialize
    over and over, you could of course call `ray_put` on it first and pass that along.

    Important assumption: the `reducer` function needs to be *associative* and *commutative*.
    Ordering from the original list of inputs is *not* maintained.

    Optional feature: integration with the progressbar in `ray_progress`. Just pass in the
    ProgressBar as well as the `key` string that you want to use. Whenever more work
    is being dispatched, the progressbar's total amount of work is updated by the dispatcher here.
    The work completion notification is *not* handled here. That needs to be done by the remote
    reducer. (Why? Because it might want to update the progressbar for each element in the shard
    while here we could only see when the whole shard is completed.)
