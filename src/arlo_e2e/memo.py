    Warning: Python's lambdas don't capture values from their environment in the way that normal functional
    programming languages work. Here's an example of how this can go wrong. The lambdas are all capturing
    the same object for `i` rather than each individual value::
        > memos = [make_memo_lambda(lambda: i) for i in range(0, 10)]
        > [memo.contents for memo in memos]
        [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

    Here's how you might make copies, to ensure everything works how you would expect::
        > memos = [(lambda i: make_memo_lambda(lambda: i))(i) for i in range(0, 10)]
        > [memo.contents for memo in memos]
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
